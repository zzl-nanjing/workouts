### What we work with

<p>
This time we will work with the data of some properties of  storms during 2010 to 2015. Our data comes from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS)
</p>

### How we work

<p>
Our mainly tools are git bash and R. Git bash wil help us do the fundamental data manipulation. Then we will do more analysis and reports by R. 
</p>

<p>
We want to interpret the data intuitively, and then find sonething interesting about them. For example, we will explore the tendency for the change of the number of storms and so on.
